# SubtitleProcessing

In this project, a database of vacabulary knowlege of user is created in the first login of a user and will be updated frequently. 
Every time the user enter the name of a movie, the subtitle will be extracted, then based on the vocabulary knowledge of the user
the new words in the subtitle will be selected and their meaning with some examples will be extracted from dictionary and will
be shown to the user.

This tool helps the English language learner to learn the new words of a movie before start watching it. In this regard, the new words
will be repeated when the movie is playing and there is no need to pause and lookup the new vocabularies during watching movie.
